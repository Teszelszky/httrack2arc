Running HTTrack2Arc
-----------------------------------------------------------
You can run HTTrack2Arc using an Ant task:

> ant run -Dsource=<source_dir> -Ddestination=<destination_dir>

This way, Ant adds the needed dependencies to the class path and
no further configuration is needed.

If don't want to use Ant, make sure to add the needed
dependencies to the classpath and run HTTrack2ARc either
using (from the jar file):

> java -jar httrack2arc.jar <source_dir> <destination_dir> [--default-time=<default_time>]

or (from the java class):

> java HTTrack2ArcConverter <source_dir> <destination_dir> [--default-time=<default_time>]


source_dir: the dir with the HTTrack crawls.
destination_dir: the destination for the converted ARC files.
default_time: the default time to be given to an archived
	file if its date cannot be detected (this should be
	the date of the HTTrack crawl)
